# Instructions

## CLIs

This python (3.13) repo uses the astral.sh stack along other CLIs:

- `devcontainer` - environment isolation
- `just` - common repo commands management
- `pre-commit` - triggers all of the following CLIs
- `uv` - venv and CLIs management
- `ruff` - format and lint
- `ty` - type checking
- `pytest` - testing
- `tox` - tests automation
- `typos` - spell checking
- `commitlint` - conventional commits adherence
- `pysentry` - dependency security
- `osv-scanner` - general security
- `claude` - for an objective AI review
- `lintok` - file size linter
- `ties` - file-to-file sync with transformations
- `yamlfmt` - yaml format and lint
- `biomejs` - json format and lint
- `dockerfmt` - dockerfile format and lint
- `rumdl` - markdown format and lint
- `lychee` - broken link detection
- `taplo` - general toml format and lint
- `pyproject-fmt` - pyproject.toml format and lint
- `tox-toml-fmt` - tox.toml format and lint

## Git

Commit messages must follow the conventional commits standard like so:  

```text
`<type>`(`<scope>`): `<up-to-60-characters>`  
`<optional-details>`  
Assisted-by: `<name-of-code-assistant>`  
```

## Just Pre-Commit

Run checks via `just p` (changed files) or `just pa` (all files).

- If unsure of current state or starting after manual edits, run `just p` first to identify pre-existing issues.
- You may proceed without `just p` if confident, but stay vigilant for baseline errors.
- Favor `just` commands over direct CLI execution.

## Code

Follow the Test-Driven-Developement (TDD) methodology.

When reading code, files or terminal outputs - try to read
necessary lines and information only, to reduce token usage.
You may use `grep`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`, `jq`, `xargs` and so on.

Try to keep files shorter than 500 lines.

Any code or file significantly generated or edited by you
must have at least one inline/header comment:  

```text
Generated by `<name-of-code-assistant>`
```

or  

```text
Edited by `<name-of-code-assistant>`  
```
