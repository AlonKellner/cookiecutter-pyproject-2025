## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)/[Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads) (or any IDE with [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) support)
* [Generate a GPG key and add it to github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
* [Configure a GPG key as your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

### Steps

* `git clone https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.__gh_slug }}.git`
* Add a [github access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) to ./.devcontainer/.env:

  ```bash
  echo "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token-here>" > ./.devcontainer/.env
  ```

* Open using VSCode (or Cursor):
  * `ctrl+shift+p`/`cmd+shift+p`
  * Type "Reopen"
  * Select `Reopen in Container`
  * Wait until everything finished loading/running

### [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)

The `pre-commit` setup in this repo uses `claude` code to
automatically review changes.  
By default, `claude` will not be configured and will automatically
pass in the `pre-commit`.  

If you want to use `claude` to review changes, you can read about
[Claude Code Deployment](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/third-party-integrations).

## Tooling

This python (3.13) repo uses the astral.sh stack along other CLIs:
1. `devcontainer` - environment isolation
2. `just` - common commands management
3. `pre-commit` - triggers all of the following CLIs
4. `uv` - venv and CLIs management
5. `ruff` - format and lint
6. `ty` - type checking
7. `pytest` - testing
8. `tox` - tests automation
9. `typos` - spell checking
10. `commitlint` - conventional commits adherence
11. `pip-audit` - dependency security
12. `trivy` - general security
13. `claude` - for an objective AI review
14. `lintok` - file size linter
15. `ties` - file-to-file sync with transformations
16. `yamlfmt` - yaml format and lint
17. `biomejs` - json format and lint
18. `rumdl` - markdown format and lint
19. `lychee` - broken link detection
20. `taplo` - general toml format and lint
21. `pyproject-fmt` - pyproject.toml format and lint
22. `tox-toml-fmt` - tox.toml format and lint

This stack seems overwhelming, but you will never need to dive into
any of it.  
This stack is managed by `devcontainers`, `pre-commit` and `just`,
thanks to those tools it's easy to setup and easy to use even
without tool specific knowledge.

For daily commands and their uses try:

```bash
just --list
```

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# This runs everything on the current changes
just pre-commit  # or `just p`

# Run all pre-commit checks on all files
just pre-commit-all  # or `just pa`
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests on all python versions and coverage on latest python
just test  # or `just t`
```
